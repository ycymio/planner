###### Get Started

- render` returns a tree of React components that will eventually render to HTML
- React is **safe**. We are not generating HTML strings so XSS protection is the default.
- The `<div>` tags are not actual DOM nodes; they are instantiations of React `div` components.
- React **composable**: a key tenet of maintainable frontends.
